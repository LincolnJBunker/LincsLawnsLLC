    <p>My name is Lincoln Bunker. I am from Cottonwood Heights, Utah, and have been over 5 years of experience in professional lawn care, powerwashing, and grill cleaning. I am currently studying computer science and love to program.
        I love helping others, and do my best to provide my services to your exact needs. In my free time I love to ski, hike, rock climb, and run. My Fiance√© Kylie and I are getting married in July, and plan to 
        continue our studies at UVU.
